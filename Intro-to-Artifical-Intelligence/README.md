Intro-to-Artificial-Intelligence
================================
This is a collection of 3 projects I did with one other partner during my time at UCSD.
Our first project implemented local search algorithms, BFS, DFS, A* and Greedy best-first search to solve an 8-puzzle.
Our second project was to implement adversarial search algorithms, Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning, for a Checkers Competition.
Our second project was to implement Bayesian Networks using Rejection sampling, Weighted sampling and Gibbs sampling.
