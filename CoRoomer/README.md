CoRoomer
========
This was a side project I worked on  during my free time while taking college courses. 
We wanted to do what cragslist did, which was connect buyers with sellers,
but we focused our area around off-campus housing for college students.
The information we collected from sellers included the apartment of which
they were posting about, the subject of the post, the price of the apartment,
the sellers email, how long the post would be listed for(we had options for 1 week,
2 weeks, and 1 month), and misc. comments about the apartment. I set up the backend
of the site with LAMP and we use some javascript and GoogleMaps API on the frontend
to make some visualizations about the locations of the apartments relative to the
school campus.
