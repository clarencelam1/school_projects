...This was a side project I worked on during my free time in college. 
We wanted to do what cragslist did, which was connect buyers with sellers,
but our focus was on finding off-campus housing for college students.
The information we collected from sellers included the apartment name,
the subject of the post, the price of the list, the sellers email,
how long the post would be listed for(we had options for 1 week,
2 weeks, and 1 month), and misc. comments about the apartment listing.
I set up the backend of the site with LAMP and we use some javascript and GoogleMaps
API on the frontend to make some visualizations about the locations
of the apartments relative to the UCSD school campus.
